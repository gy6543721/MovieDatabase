<p>Coding Challenge</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>An imaginary client has tasked us to build an app where their customers are able to search for movies, see details for a given movie, favorite that movie, see all favorited movies. <br />
The app will mainly use themoviedb.org's API and will put the media front and center for the user.</p>

<h2>Steps to implement</h2>

<p>1) Make an API key following the steps here: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction <br />
2) Film search (using this API endpoint <strong>GET</strong> https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api<em>key={apikey}&amp;query={search</em>query}), display the films in whatever UI you want. <br />
3) The user should be able to see details of the film (endpoint <strong>GET</strong> https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie<em>id}?api</em>key={apikey}) <br />
4) The user should be able to favorite and unfavorite a movie (use whatever local storage that you think make sense) <br />
5) The user should be able to see a list of favorite movies (and from there go to the detail movie screen)  </p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Spend some time on transitions/animations and the small tweaks that make an app <em>nice to use</em>  </li>
<li>Focus on good naming  </li>
<li>If you end up with complex code, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, document the thoughts behind it  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Before you start</h2>

<p>You can use any frameworks and/or architecture you like, any UI, make as many or little comments you like, just remember that we will be looking through the code and want to get a good understanding of your skills. <br />
We know you are under a time limit and we will of course take this into account. It's perfectly fine to cut corners and focus on certain parts.</p>

<h2>How to deliver your code</h2>

<ul>
<li>We prefer that you use git even though you shouldn't make your code public, that way we can track progress and the way you work</li>
<li>Push to a private repository we invited</li>
<li>Send it to your contact person as a link to a hosted location or if the zip is small enough, attach it. </li>
</ul>
